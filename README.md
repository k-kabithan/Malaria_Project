# Malaria_Project

Introduction

The datasets were collected by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and subsequently used in this project. This project consisted of 2 datasets that displayed the number of new malaria cases per 1000 population at risk per year and reported cases and fatalities per countries alongside the WHO regions. The dataset was analysed using Python to identify correlations between the number of cases and deaths, and factors such as the region and year.  Despite the rise of cases, the fatalities across 2000-2017 fluctuate this could be due to third world countries struggling to acquire the necessary medicine.

## Introduction

This project aims to analyse the Malaria datasets collected by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and gain insights into the trends and patterns of Malaria cases across different countries and regions. The analysis revealed that despite the medical advances, the number of cases worldwide keeps increasing due to various factors, including insufficient funding for prevention and control effects, climate change is also believed to contribute to the spread of malaria as higher temperatures are more favourable to mosquitoes. 
### Why did you choose to undertake this project?
I chose to undertake this project because I am passionate about global health and the fight against infectious diseases. Malaria is a major public health issue, especially in developing countries, and I wanted to use my skills in data analysis to help shed light on the problem and identify potential solutions. I believe that data analysis can play a crucial role in understanding the complex factors that contribute to the spread of malaria and in developing more effective strategies for prevention and treatment.

## Data

### Brief explanation of the Malaria dataset used in the project.
The dataset was analysed using Python to identify correlations between the number of cases and deaths, and factors such as the region and year. The dataset includes information on the number of new malaria cases per 1000 population at risk per year, reported cases and fatalities per countries alongside the WHO regions, and other various properties.

### Source of the dataset.
Data sets was made by the World Health Organisation (WHO), it contains small variety of data such as the country, WHO region, number of cases and number of deaths. This data was collected between 2000-2017.  **[Kaggle Malaria Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imdevskp/malaria-dataset)**

### Explanation of the features included in the dataset.
As mentioned both data sets had similar columns: Country, Year, Number of cases, Number of deaths, WHO region. WHO regions are regions in the world that the World Health Organisation divided for the purpose of reporting and analysing. Both data sets had missing values in different countries and time period, "NULL", values which were dropped for the sake of having clean data where it would be easier to manipulate and analyse. For  further analysis, the data types were modified to best represent the column such as converting them to int, this significantly simplified the coding process. No further modifications were necessary, besides changing the column names to make it more clear and to have an easier time for future modifications or analysis.
